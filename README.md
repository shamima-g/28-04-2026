# AI-First UI Development Template

[![PR Quality Gates](https://github.com/stadium-software/stadium-8/actions/workflows/pr-checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stadium-software/stadium-8/actions/workflows/pr-checks.yml)

Build production-ready Next.js applications with AI-guided development.

**What is this?** A starter template that lets you build web applications by describing what you want in plain language. Claude Code AI agents handle the planning, coding, testing, and quality checks—you focus on _what_ to build, not _how_ to build it.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Project

**Option A: GitHub UI**

- Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
- Clone your new repository

**Option B: GitHub CLI**

```bash
gh repo create MY-PROJECT-NAME --template stadium-software/stadium-8 --private --clone
```

### 2. Install & Configure

```bash
cd .\MY-PROJECT-NAME\web && npm install
```

### 3. Start Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Building Features

### The Recommended Workflow

1. **Add your specifications to `/documentation`**
   - Create a feature spec (e.g., `my-feature.md`) describing what you want to build
   - Include your OpenAPI spec (e.g., `api.yaml`) if your feature calls backend APIs
   - See [documentation/README.md](documentation/README.md) for templates and examples

2. **Run `/start` in Claude Code**
   - The AI reads your specs and guides you through the entire development process
   - You'll approve epics and stories before implementation begins
   - Tests are written first (TDD), then code, then quality checks

### Example

```
documentation/
├── user-dashboard.md   # Your feature spec
├── api.yaml            # Your OpenAPI spec
└── sample-data.json    # Optional: example data for context
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/start
```

The AI agents will take it from there—planning, coding, testing, and validating quality gates.

### Workflow Commands

```
/start          # Begin TDD workflow — scans documentation/ and gathers requirements
/status         # See where you are in the workflow
/continue       # Resume an interrupted workflow
/dashboard      # Open visual dashboard in browser to track progress
/quality-check  # Validate all quality gates before committing
```

## AI Agents

This template includes specialized Claude Code agents for **Test-Driven Development**:

| Phase       | Agent                   | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| INTAKE      | intake-agent            | Scan docs, gather requirements, produce intake manifest      |
| INTAKE      | intake-brd-review-agent | Review completeness, produce Feature Requirements Spec       |
| DESIGN      | design-api-agent        | Design OpenAPI spec from requirements (conditional)          |
| DESIGN      | design-style-agent      | Formalize styling into CSS design tokens (conditional)       |
| DESIGN      | design-wireframe-agent  | Generate text-based wireframes for UI planning (conditional) |
| SCOPE       | feature-planner         | Define all epics with dependency map                         |
| STORIES     | feature-planner         | Define stories per epic with acceptance criteria             |
| REALIGN     | feature-planner         | Check for cross-story impacts before each story              |
| WRITE-TESTS | test-generator          | Generate failing tests (TDD "Red")                           |
| IMPLEMENT   | developer               | Make tests pass (TDD "Green")                                |
| QA          | code-reviewer           | Review, quality gates, commit                                |

## Quality Gates

5 automated gates (Security, Code Quality, Testing, Performance, Functional) run on pre-commit and PR. Use `/quality-check` to validate locally.

See [Quality Gates Documentation](.template-docs/Help/Quality-Gates.md) for details, checklists, and bypass procedures.

## Template Updates

This template includes a weekly sync workflow that creates PRs for infrastructure updates. Your `/web` code is never overwritten automatically.

See [Receiving Template Updates](.template-docs/Getting-Started.md#receiving-template-updates) for details, or check [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.
